# Lane–Emden Equation Article

This repository contains a self-written review article on the **Lane–Emden equation** and its applications in astrophysics, especially in the context of **polytropic models of stellar structure**. The article covers the derivation of the Lane–Emden equation, analytical and numerical solutions, and physical implications for white dwarfs and stellar evolution.
